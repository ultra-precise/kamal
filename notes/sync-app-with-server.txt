Saving State :

During app usage, you should ensure that its state is saved periodically to the offline data store, 
and save state locally when user closes the app (though IndexedDB does not allow this).

----------
Syncing with server side :

Your app should also save its data back to the server periodically. 
If your app is offline you should consider building a queueing solution that can handle a lack of connectivity, 
aiming to save the updates once the network is available again. 
We have developed Mozilla Kinto (https://kinto.readthedocs.org/) a self-hostable service to let you do that.

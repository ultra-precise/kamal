Responsive Web Design:



Managing Browser-Screen Orientation (Portrait, Landscape) :



/* For portrait browser-screen */


@media screen and (orientation: portrait) {

/* CSS Styles for Portrait */

}





/* For landscape browser-screen */


@media screen and (orientation: landscape) {

/* CSS Styles for Landscape */

}



Note: The orientation media query actually applies based on the orientation of the browser window (or iframe) not the orientation of the device.

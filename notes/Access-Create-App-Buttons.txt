[ADVANCE OPTIONS] ->

1. Add more forms and reports to a navigation buttons of HomePage Form ->

Drag the form or report from the Navigation Pane to the [Add New] button.
Access creates the new navigation button and displays the form or report in the object pane.

2. Change color and shape of a navigation button ->

Right Click on Form > Layout View > select Button > Form Layout Tools > Format > Control Formatting section > Quick Styles/Change Shape/Shape Effects

3. Set the navigation form as the default display form ->

Because a navigation form is often used as a switchboard or “home page” for a database, it makes sense to display it by default each time that the database is opened. Also, because the Access Navigation Pane is not available in a browser, specifying a default Web Display Form is a very important step in creating a Web database.

Use this procedure to set the navigation form as the default display form.

File > Help > Options > Current Database > Application Options > Display Form

To set the default form that is displayed when you open the database in Access, under "Application Options", select the form from the "Display Form" list.

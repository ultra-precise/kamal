--------------------
GET (Form SUBMIT) :

GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL. 

Since the GET method has been used, you'll see the URL 
www.foo.com/?say=Hi&to=Mom 
appear in the browser address bar when you submit the form.


The HTTP request looks like this:


GET /?say=Hi&to=Mom HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.com


<form action="http://foo.com" method="get">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
    <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send my greetings</button>
  </div>
</form>

================================
POST (Form SUBMIT) :

POST method is a little different. It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.

Let's look at an example â€” this is the same form we looked at in the GET section above, but with the method attribute set to post.


When the form is submitted using the POST method, you get no data appended to the URL, and the HTTP request looks like so, with the data included in the request body instead:


POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 13

say=Hi&to=Mom
----------------

The Content-Length header indicates the size of the body, and the Content-Type header indicates the type of resource sent to the server. We'll discuss these headers later on.


<form action="http://foo.com" method="post">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
    <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send my greetings</button>
  </div>
</form>


======================================================
Viewing Headers and HTTP requests:


HTTP requests are never displayed to the user (if you want to see them, you need to use tools such as the Firefox Network Monitor or the Chrome Developer Tools). As an example, your form data will be shown as follows in the Chrome Network tab. After submitting the form:

Press F12
Select "Network"
Select "All"
Select "foo.com" in the "Name" tab
Select "Headers"

You can then get the form data, as shown in the image below.

Function Scope:

Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function, 
because the variable is defined only in the scope of the function. 
However, a function can access all variables and functions defined inside the scope in which it is defined. 
In other words, a function defined in the global scope can access all variables defined in the global scope. 
A function defined inside another function can also access all variables defined in its parent function and 
any other variable to which the parent function has access.



------
// The following variables are defined in the global scope
var num1 = 20,
    num2 = 3,
    name = 'Chamahk';

// This function is defined in the global scope
function multiply() {
  return num1 * num2;
}

multiply(); // Returns 60





---------
// A nested function example
function getScore() {
  var num1 = 2,
      num2 = 3;
  
  function add() {
    return name + ' scored ' + (num1 + num2);
  }
  
  return add();
}

getScore(); // Returns "Chamahk scored 5"

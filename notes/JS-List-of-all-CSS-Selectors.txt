[Note: To test this function the webpage must be hosted on a Live domain, you cannot test this function on localhost]


The styleSheets property on the document object returns a list of the stylesheets that have been loaded on that document. You can access these stylesheets and their rules individually using the stylesheet, style, and CSSRule objects, as demonstrated in this example, which prints out all of the style rule selectors to the console (console.log)



<script>

var ss = document.styleSheets;

for(var i = 0; i < ss.length; i++) {
  for(var j = 0; j < ss[i].cssRules.length; j++) {
    console.log( ss[i].cssRules[j].selectorText + "\n" );
  }
}


</script>



For a document with a single stylesheet in which the following three rules are defined:

<style.css>

body { background-color: darkblue; }
p { font-face: Arial; font-size: 10pt; margin-left: .125in; }
#lumpy { display: none; }


</style.css>


This script outputs the following:

BODY
P
#LUMPY

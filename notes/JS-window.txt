==================
Window.postMessage()
Provides a secure means for one window to send a string of data to another window, which need not be within the same domain as the first.


-------------
window-1, (https://www.google.com) code:


function receiveMessage(event) {

// Do we trust the sender of this message?

    if (event.origin !== "https://www.bing.com")
    return;
  
  // event.source is popup window (window-2)
  // event.data is "Japan"

console.log(event.data);

}

window.addEventListener("message", receiveMessage, false);

var popup = window.open("https://www.bing.com");
popup.postMessage("Russia", "https://www.bing.com");


---------------
window-2 (popup window), (https://www.google.com) code:


function receiveMessage(event)
{

// Do we trust the sender of this message?

  if (event.origin !== "https://www.google.com")
  return;

  // event.source is window.opener (window-1)
  // event.data is "Russia"
  // Assuming you've verified the origin of the received message (which
  // you must do in any case), a convenient idiom for replying to a
  // message is to call postMessage on event.source and provide
  // event.origin as the targetOrigin.

  event.source.postMessage("Japan", event.origin);

console.log(event.data);

}

window.addEventListener("message", receiveMessage, false);

//OR you can use this:

window.opener.postMessage("Japan", "https://www.google.com");

Letting the user pick a color :

<input type="color">
--------------------------------------------------------------------
  <label for="colorPicker">Border color:</label>
  <input type="color" value="#8888ff" id="colorPicker">

There are many situations in which your web site may need to let the user select a color. 
Perhaps you have a customizable user interface, or you're implementing a drawing app. 
Maybe you have editable text and need to let the user choose the text color.

HTML now provides support for browsers to provide color-picker for your use through the <input> element, 
by using "color" as the value of type attribute of <input> element.

The <input> element represents a color only in hexadecimal string notation.

Example: Picking a color

Let's look at a simple example, in which the user can choose a color. 
As the user adjusts the color, the border around the example changes to reflect the new color. 
After finishing up and picking the final color, the color picker's value is displayed.

"Distance Education Council"

The Distance Education Council (DEC), was established in 1991 under section 16(7)
read with Section 5(2) of the IGNOU Act, 1985. As per clause (2) (a) of the statute
28, the DEC is responsible for the promotion and coordination of the Open and
Distance Learning system in the country. The DEC has been taking various initiatives
to maintain the standards of Distance Education in the Country.
Expansion of the Open and Distance Learning (ODL) in India in recent decades has
been tremendous. Open Universities (OUs) and Distance Education Institutions
(DEIs) of dual mode universities/institutions are offering programmes /courses
through the distance mode. Single-mode open universities have increased from four in
number during the 8th Plan period to 14 in the 10th Plan period. The number of dual
mode universities offering programmes through the distance mode (DEIs) has risen to
more than 140. This is due to the fact that the growth in the infrastructure 
for face-toface instruction is unable to match the educational demands of the ever-increasing
number of aspiring students. At present nearly 25% students of higher education in
the country are enrolled in the ODL system.
The DEC, as an apex agency, is responsible for recognizing ODL institutions in India.
It is mandatory for all institutions to seek prior approval of the DEC for all existing
and new programmes offered through distance mode. The guidelines for seeking
approval together with necessary proformas for furnishing requisite information are
issued by the DEC.

"Recognition"

The Government of India issued the Gazette notification No 44 on 1st March, 1995,
according to which: “all the qualifications awarded through Distance Education by
the Universities....... stand automatically recognized for the purpose of employment
to posts and services under Central Government, provided it has been approved by
Distance Education Council,…..”.
In keeping with this notification the DEC started the process of recognition. The
DEC recognizes institutions on the basis of their preparedness to offer programmes
through distance mode depending upon their infrastructure, human and other
resources, learner support system, and teaching learning.
Recognition is the certification for offering education through open and distance
learning (ODL) mode. It is, therefore, mandatory for institutions to get recognition
from the DEC

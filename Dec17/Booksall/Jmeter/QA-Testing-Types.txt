Manual Software Testing :

Testing of software by test cases executed manually by a QA Analyst.
QA Analyst generates test reports without the help of any automation software testing tools.
Manual Testing is suitable for Exploratory, Usability and Adhoc Testing. It should also be used where the AUT changes frequently.

Automation Software Testing :

Testers write code/test scripts to automate test execution, by using appropriate automation tools.

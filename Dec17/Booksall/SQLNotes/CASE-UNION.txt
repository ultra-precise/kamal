Trick-1
CASE (Case Expression) -

Question: 

Sort contact_type in the order: 
all fixed lines, all mobile phones, all emails, all icq's. 
Within each group sort over the contact_value.

///////
Answer:


SELECT contact_type,contact_value, 
       CASE contact_type
         WHEN 'fixed line' THEN 0
         WHEN 'mobile'     THEN 1
         WHEN 'email'      THEN 2
         WHEN 'icq'        THEN 3
         ELSE                   4
       END As Case
       FROM   contact
ORDER  BY       Case, contact_value;

Trick-2
UNION (Set Operations) -

Question:

Often one would like to achieve that the rows from the first SELECT are ordered independent 
from those of the second SELECT. We can do this by adding a virtuel column(dummy) to the result of both SELECTs.

///////
Answer:


SELECT '1' as dummy, firstname
FROM   person
  UNION
SELECT '2', lastname
FROM   person
ORDER BY dummy, firstname;

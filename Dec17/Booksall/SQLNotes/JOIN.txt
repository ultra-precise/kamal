"Database Normalization" and 'JOIN' operation :


Data should be stored in such a way that no redundant information exists in the database. 
For example, if our database includes groups of people who, in each case, all pursue the same hobby, 
then we would rather avoid repeatedly storing the same static details about a given hobby; 
namely in every record about one of the hobby's enthusiasts. Likewise, we would rather avoid repeatedly 
storing the same detailed information about an individual hobbyist; namely in every record about one of 
that person's hobbies. 

Instead we create independent person and hobby tables and point from one to the other. 
This technique for grouping data in separate, redundancy-free tables is called "database normalization". 
Such separation also tends to simplify the logic and enhance the flexibility of assembling precisely 
the items needed for a given purpose. This assembly is accomplished by means of the 'JOIN' operation.

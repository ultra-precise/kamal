UNIQUE vs PRIMARY KEY -


The UNIQUE constraint has a similar meaning as the PRIMARY KEY phrase. But there are two slight differences.

First, the values of different rows of a UNIQUE column are not allowed to be equal, which is the same as with PK. 
But they are allowed to hold the NULL value, which is different from PK. The existence of NULL values has an implication. 

As the term null = null never evaluates to true (it evaluates to "unknown") there may exist multiple rows 
with the NULL value in a column which is defined to be UNIQUE.

Second, only one PK definition per table is allowed. In contrast, there may be many UNIQUE constraints (on different columns).


Summary -

1. "NULL" value -

in PRIMARY KEY column "NULL" value is not allowed
in UNIQUE column "NULL" value is allowed in multiple rows

because in UNIQUE column:

(null = null) does not equal "true"
it equals "unknown"


2. multiple columns -

one table can have "only one" PRIMARY KEY column.
one table can have multiple UNIQUE columns.

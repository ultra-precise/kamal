String is immutable array-like object -


A String object has one property, "length", that indicates the number of UTF-16 code units in the string. For example, the following code assigns "x" the value 13, because "Hello, World!" has 13 characters, each represented by one UTF-16 code unit. You can access each code unit using an array bracket style. 

You can't change individual characters of string because strings are immutable array-like objects:


const hello = 'Hello, World!';
const helloLength = hello.length;
hello[0] = 'L'; // This has no effect, because strings are immutable
hello[0]; // This returns "H"

Exponentiation operator (**)

Calculates the base to the exponent power, that is, baseexponent

2 ** 3 returns 8
10 ** -1 returns 0.1

String newLine without backtick(`) -


You can also escape line breaks by preceding them with backslash. The backslash and line break are both removed from the value of the string.

var str = 'this string \
is broken \
across multiple \
lines.'
console.log(str);   // this string is broken across multiple lines.

Although JavaScript does not have "heredoc" syntax, you can get close by adding a line break escape and an escaped line break at the end of each line:

var poem = 
'Roses are red,\n\
Violets are blue.\n\
Sugar is sweet,\n\
and so is foo.'

...................

ECMAScript 2015 introduces a new type of literal, namely template literals. This allows for many new features including multiline strings!

var poem = 
`Roses are red, 
Violets are blue. 
Sugar is sweet, 
and so is foo.`

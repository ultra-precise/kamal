public class Distance {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

	public void printDistance(dist) {
System.out.println(dist);
}

}

---------------------------------
Rule-1
There should be only one "public class" in the file. Your filename should be exactly this class's name with 
java file-extension. Example : 
ClassName.java
Distance.java

Rule-2
The entry point of file execution is "main" method, your program executes "main" method.

Rule-3
Other functions you can declare/define parallel to "main" method as siblings.

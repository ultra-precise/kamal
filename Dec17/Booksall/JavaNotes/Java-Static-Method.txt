"static" Methods -


Any method prefixed with "static" keyword is called static method. 
Static methods can be called directly (in a static or non-object context).

Non-static methods cannot be called directly, you can call it on an object-instance.

Example:

private static int intValue(String data) {
  return Integer.parseInt(data);
}

intValue(args[0]); //directly calling the static method "intValue"

public void printDistance() {
    System.out.println("Distance between " + point0 + " and " + point1 + " is " + point0.distance(point1));
}

Distance dist = new Distance(
dist.printDistance(); //calling non-static method on an object-instance
}

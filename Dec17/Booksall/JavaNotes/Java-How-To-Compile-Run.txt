Explaination :


public class Myprogram {


This is the first line of our java program. Every java application must have at least one class definition that consists of class keyword followed by class name. When I say keyword, it means that it should not be changed, we should use it as it is. However the class name can be anything.
I have made the class public by using public access modifier, I will cover access modifier in a separate post, all you need to know now that a java file can have any number of classes but it can have only one public class and the file name should be same as public class name.


------------------------------------------
public static void main(String[] args)  {


This is our next line in the program, lets break it down to understand it -


public: This makes the main method public that means that we can call the method from outside the class.

static: We do not need to create object for static methods to run. They can run itself.

void: It does not return anything.

main: It is the method name. This is the entry point method from which the JVM can run your program.

(String[] args): Used for command line arguments that are passed as strings. We will cover that in a separate post.


-------------------------------------------
System.out.println("This is my first program in java");


This method prints the contents inside the double quotes into the console and inserts a newline after.

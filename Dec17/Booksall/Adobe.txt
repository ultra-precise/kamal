Tell me about a time when you needed information / feedback from a client and they were not responsive, or didn't adhere to your timeline?  
Answer:
I said that I would try to talk to them directly. If that didn't work, I would need to escalate this to the project manager or the project sponsor .. depending on who was available and what the situation was. As well, I would be highlighting this in my weekly status report and label it as a potential issue (red flag) that might impact my ability to deliver the final product on time.
